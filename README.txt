The code can be run on either Jupyter notebook or uploaded to Google Colab and run.
We used Colab to run it with GPU enabled which we recommend as well.
We assume you have all the dependencies installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, etc.).

The dataset is in a public repository (GitHub). We included the link on the notebook but it's here as well:
"https://github.com/SBodapati11/Sentiment-Prediction/blob/main/yelp_labelled.txt?raw=true".

You can simply open the code in Google Colab or Jupyter notebook and run all cells.

***Please note the values might be slightly different after running on your PC. 
However, the differences are extremely small and do not alter our conclusions and analysis.
The differences are because the training and testing splits are randomized.**
